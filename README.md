# Chat Application
# Simple chat application using React, Node.JS, Scoket.io

Some of the chat options are:

- /nick <name> - sets your name for the chat
- /think <message> - makes text appear dark gray, instead of black
- /oops - removes the last message sent
- (smile) produces a smiley face, (wink) a winking face
- /fadelast - reduces visibility of last message
- /highlight <message> - makes font bigger and background darker
- /countdown <timer> <url> - redirects the other person to the url in timer seconds

There is a typing indicator next to the friend's name at the top of the chat.

The app is hosted on:
